# Movies & Subscriptions Management Web Application - Front (React.js)


Movies & Subscription management web application
is a M.E.R.N Stack project that simulates an internal corporate management system for managing movie subscriptions.

The project consists of a React client and Node.js Web Service's in REST API configuration.
In fact, the client is connected to four WS servers, two of them are internal (self-built) And two more are external.
The Web services using JSON files and MongoDB with the Mongoose layer as additional data sources.

<b>On the client side I will demonstrate:</b>

• Using Single Page Application – in order to obtain a fast and smooth user experience similar to an application, with this approach we can reduce the number of renderings, refreshing, and reloading of the pages and even reduce the traffic on the server side.
• Using Routers, Nested Routers.
• Using Context API - in order to transfer information throughout the hierarchy of components while understanding the "Composition" principle and thus avoid "contamination" of components that have no use for this information.
• Working with several data sources (internal/external web-services, JSON files, MongoDB) while performing complex data shaping.
• Using hooks to integrate into the life cycle of components.


<b>On the server side I will demonstrate:</b>
• Correct distribution of components while implementing the Micro services configuration for my server - separation of processes using DAL components and Business Logic layers
• Using JWT - for the purpose of securing the Routers and authenticating users, only authorized users will be able to receive and write information to the servers. In addition, I will use the Token that JWT created for me to configure a Session Timeout, time limit for users in the system and to prevent a single token that leaked out to be used for unauthorized access to the servers.
• Combination of Master Details with CRUD + work with JSON files + work with external Web Services.


## System Architecture

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41838762/214566197-01ea6b42-f00c-4b57-bd82-912d8f1c6f22.png)


## Data Sources Structures:

<ins>Users.json</ins><br/>
A json file stores the system users data. Each user has an ID , name , created date , session timeout

<ins>Permissions.json</ins><br/>
A json file stores the users permissions. Each record (user) has a user id and array of permissions.


<ins>UsersDB</ins><br/>
A MongoDB database who stores :<br/>
     _id (ObjectId)<br/>
    Username (String)<br/>
    Password ( String)<br/>
    Classification (String)<br/>

<ins>SubscriptionsDB</ins><br/>
A MongoDB database holds 3 collections :
1. Members – A collection that stores the subscription members data pulled from the
Members WS at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users :

    _id (ObjectId)<br/>
    Name (String)<br/>
    Email (String)<br/>
    City (String)<br/>
    
2. Movies – A collection that stores movies data pulled from the Movies WS as
https://api.tvmaze.com/shows

     _id (ObjectId)
     Name (String)<br/>
     Genres ( Array of Strings) <br/>
     Image ( A string – The url of the image picture)<br/>
     Premiered (Date)<br/>
     
     
3.Subscriptions – A collection stores the data of all the subscriptions:<br/>

      _id (ObjectId)<br/>
      MemberId (ObjectId)<br/>
      Movies ( an Array of { movieId : Object Id, date : Date} ) - This field store all the movies
      the member (subscription) watched and their dates<br/>

## System Components:

### Subscriptions WS : <br/>
This is a Node based REST api that provide services/data about members (subscriptions), movies and the
movies the members watched.<br/>
When the REST API server starts, it pulled all the data from the external members & movies web services
and populated the relevant data in the relevant collections (Members & Movies collections) in the
Subscriptions DB ( a MongoDB data base).<br/>
At this point, the Subscriptions collection is empty (as none of the members has not watched any movie
yet).<br/>
<b>From this point, all the data will be managed in the Subscriptions DB !!!</b><br/>



### Cinema WS : <br/>
This is a Node based REST API that provides a management system for movies and subscriptions.<br/>
System users<br/>
Only authorized users can log in to the web site.<br/>
The first user is the Admin and only he can manage other users (create, change & remove)<br/>

The Users.json stores the following data for every user:<br/>

   Id (The _id that created in the Data Base)<br/>
   First Name <br/>
   Last Name<br/>
   Created date<br/>
   SessionTimeOut ( number) – the duration (in minutes) a user can work on the system
   once he logged in.
   
   
The Permissions.json stores all the user permissions regarding the movies management system:<br/>

  Id (The _id that created in the Data Base)<br/>
  Permissions - an array of permissions (strings)<br/>
      “View Subscriptions”<br/>
      “Create Subscriptions”<br/>
      “Delete Subscriptions”<br/>
      “View Movies”<br/>
      “Create Movies”<br/>
      “Delete Movies”<br/>
<b>A user can have many permissions !</b><br/>


The User DB database stored a collection with the following data:<br/>
   _Id (ObjectId)<br/>
   UserName ( Required for login)<br/>
   Password ( Required for login)<br/>
   
<b>The system starts with only one (pre-defined) record of the
System Admin data (both in the json files and in the data base)</b>

### Front End : 

The Front End will be build with React & context api

#### Pages & Procedures


##### 1 – Login Page
The home page of the system. A page with username & password text box and a “Login” button. A
successful log in redirect to “Main” Page. A failed attempt will present a proper message in the same
page (Login page).
Once a user logged in – his name will be presented in all the site pages
First time users (which don’t have password yet) will click on “create account” link which will redirect
them to a “CretaeAccount” page

##### 2 – CreateAccount Page
This page will allow to a new user (that has been created by the Sys admin) to setup his login details. The
page will present 2 text boxes:
- User Name – the given UserName from the SYS Admin
- Password – a new password

A click on “Create” button will check: If the UserName exists in the data base, it will store the new
password and redirect back to LogIn page.
If the UserName is NOT exist in the data base, the page will present a proper message and the creation
will fail!
